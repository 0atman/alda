misc TODO:
  * handle STDIN

commands:
	new/delete = delete the score and start a new one
		TODO (requires server work):
			* check to see if score is non-empty
			* ask for confirmation before deleting

	parse = display the result of parsing alda code
		TODO (requires server work):
      * don't overwrite the current score when parsing code
        (score evaluation should be more immutable and not rely on top-level vars)
