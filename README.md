*New to Alda? You may be interested in reading [this blog post][alda-blog-post] as an introduction.*

Inspired by other music/audio programming languages such as [PPMCK][ppmck],
[LilyPond][lilypond] and [ChucK][chuck], Alda aims to be a
powerful and flexible programming language for the musician who wants to easily
compose and generate music on the fly, using naught but a text editor.
Alda is designed in a way that equally favors aesthetics, flexibility and
ease of use, with (eventual) support for the text-based creation of all manner
of music: classical, popular, chiptune, electroacoustic, and more!

## Features

* Easy to understand, markup-like syntax
* Perfect for musicians who don't know how to program and programmers who don't know how to music
* Represent scores as text files and play them back with the `alda` command-line tool
* [Interactive REPL](doc/alda-repl.md) lets you type Alda code and hear the results in real time
* [Underlying Clojure DSL](doc/alda-lisp.md) allows you to [use Alda directly in your Clojure project](doc/alda-now.md).
* [Inline Clojure code](doc/inline-clojure-code.md) allows you to [hack the Gibson][hackers] and write scores programmatically
* Create MIDI music using any of the instruments in the [General MIDI Sound Set][gm-sound-set]

[gm-sound-set]: http://www.midi.org/techspecs/gm1sound.php

### TODO

* [Define and use waveform synthesis instruments](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/100)
* [Import MIDI files](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/85)
* [Export to MusicXML](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/44) for inter-operability with other music software
* [A more robust REPL](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/54), tailor-made for editing scores interactively
* [A plugin system](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/37) allowing users to define custom/unofficial syntax in Alda scores

If you're a developer and you'd like to help, come on in -- [the water's fine](#contributing)!

## Syntax example

    piano: o3
    g8 a b > c d e f+ g | a b > c d e f+ g4
    g8 f+ e d c < b a g | f+ e d c < b a g4
    << g1/>g/>g/b/>d/g

For more examples, see these [example scores](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/tree/master/examples).

## Installation

> You must have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download) installed on your system in order to run Alda.
>
> (Chances are, you already have Java installed.)

### Mac OS X / Linux

* Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/releases/latest) page and download `alda`.

* Make the file executable:

        chmod +x alda

* Make `alda` available on your `$PATH`:

  > Using `/usr/local/bin` here as an example;
  > you can use any directory on your `$PATH`.

        mv alda /usr/local/bin

### Windows

* Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/releases/latest) page and download `alda.exe`.

* Make the `alda` command available by moving `alda.exe` to your system root path:

        C:\> move alda.exe %SystemRoot%

### MIDI soundfonts

Default JVM soundfonts usually are of low quality. We recommend installing a good freeware soundfont like FluidR3 to make your MIDI instruments sound a lot nicer. For your convenience, there is a script in this repo that will install the FluidR3 soundfont for Mac and Linux users.

> If you're a Windows user and you know how to install a MIDI soundfont to the Java Virtual Machine, please let us know!

To install FluidR3 on your Mac or Linux system, clone this repo and run:

    scripts/install-fluidr3

This will download FluidR3 and replace `~/.gervill/soundbank-emg.sf2` (your JVM's default soundfont) with it.

### Editor Plugins

For the best experience when editing Alda score files, install the Alda file-type plugin for your editor of choice.

> Don't see a plugin for your favorite editor? Write your own and open a Pull Request to add it here! :)

- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/archimedespi/sublime-alda)
- [Atom](https://github.com/MadcapJake/language-alda)
- [Vim](https://github.com/daveyarwood/vim-alda)

### Updating Alda

We're still working on [improving the Alda update process](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/82). Ideally you'll be able to just type `alda update` to get the latest version.

For now, you can update Alda by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/releases/latest) and repeating the install process.

## Demo

To play a file:

    alda play --file examples/bach_cello_suite_no_1.alda

To play arbitrary code:

    alda play --code "piano: c6 d12 e6 g12~4"

To start an [Alda REPL](doc/alda-repl.md):

    alda repl
