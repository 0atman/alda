# yggdrasil

A music programming language for musicians, implemented in Clojure.

Inspired by other music/audio programming languages such as [PPMCK][ppmck], 
[LilyPond][lilypond] and [ChucK][chuck], the goal of Yggdrasil is to provide a 
powerful and extremely flexible programming language for the musician who wants 
to easily compose and generate music on the fly using only a text editor and a 
compiler. Yggdrasil is designed in a way that equally favors aesthetics, 
flexibility and ease of use, with (eventual) support for the text-based creation 
of all manner of music: classical, popular, chiptune, electroacoustic, and more!
