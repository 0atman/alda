# Markers**Markers** can be placed and referenced at any point during a score, and in any instrument part. e.g. `%chorus` will place a marker called "chorus" at the current offset, and then using `@chorus` at any point will set the current [offset](offset.md) to that of the "chorus" marker.## Acceptable Marker NamesMarker names must adhere to the following rules:* They must be at least 2 characters long.* The first two characters must be letters (either uppercase or lowercase).* After the first two characters, they may contain any combination of:  * letters (upper- or lowercase)  * digits 0-9  * any of the following characters: `_ - + ' ( )`
