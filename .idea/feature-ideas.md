#### Feature Ideas

- alternate syntax for changing attributes over time (ex. cresc/decresc with time parameters, instead of having to change the volume manually in steps)
- instrument specific commands/modes (guitar, winds, etc.)
- drums / percussion
- waveform synthesis
- a "sampler" instrument
- harness the power of randomness
